WORTHY READS for 2020-12-18
==========================

Worthy Reads from Equitable Growth:

1. Smart young whippersnapper Austin Clemens is completely correct here. Shifting the conversation about economic growth away from the topline aggregate number to a more nuanced, distributional assessment holds enormous promise in terms of getting the American political system in public sphere to focus on what is really important, and what works: **Austin Clemens**: _New Distributional Snapshot of U.S. Personal Income Is a Landmark Federal Statistical Product_ <https://equitablegrowth.org/new-distributional-snapshot-of-u-s-personal-income-is-a-landmark-federal-statistical-product/>: ‘Policymakers and analysts should pay close attention to future releases of BEA’s distribution of personal income. Trends in the share of income held by top earners will indicate whether the benefits of the strong post-Great Recession economy have accrued to Americans broadly or to upper-income Americans more narrowly. Going forward, this new tool should give pause to those who target growth as a catch-all metric to indicate economic success. Too often, growth has been tilted in favor of those who are already doing well…

2. If the experience of the Internet tells us anything, it is that Open standards are a true bonanza, a true gold rush, a true El Dorado. Unfortunately, they do not produce very many steeply wild gardens to produce mammoth profits for venture capitalists and shareholders. And, even more unfortunately, neither the Bush nor the Obama administration understood the least thing about the importance of the government’s role in nudging the information sector into configurations with open standards: **Michael Kades & Fiona M. Scott Morton**: _Interoperability as a Competition Remedy for Digital Networks_ https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/interoperability-as-a-competition-remedy-for-digital-networks/>: ‘Mandatory interoperability based on robust and effective rules could overcome the network effects that protect the incumbent from entry, maximizing the potential for new entrants to enter at minimal cost, compete in the market, and take share from the incumbent. This remedy could be ordered in addition to other relief such as a divestiture, and indeed could be complementary to it, or stand on its own. In today’s internet-based network markets, interoperability carries no incremental costs such as dedicated wires and machines that were true of the telecom interoperability of past decades. Its main cost is the establishment of an open standard…

3. This is a very nice line from Heather Boushey: “policymakers [nned to] to recognize that markets cannot perform the work of government”: **Heather Boushey**: _How to Make America More Equal_ <https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2020/12/how-to-make-america-more-equal-boushey.htm> ‘Transforming the US economy requires policymakers to recognize that markets cannot perform the work of government. The first step is to eradicate COVID-19…. [Then] the United States [needs] to address its long-term problems: a costly health system that leaves millions with insufficient care, an education system designed not to end inequality but to preserve it, lack of basic economic stability for most families, and climate change.
Major public investments are required to deal with each issue…

4. And here I am, arguing that the “risk perspective” on public debt accumulation is simply wrong—that the big risks are run by not running up the debt to rapidly return the economy to full employment: **Brad DeLong**: _Fear of Rising Interest Rates No Reason to Shy Away from Fiscal Expansion_ <http://delongtoday.com>: ‘Back in 2012 Larry Summers and I tried to teach the world… two lessons: First… that when interest rates were very low the debt was not a drag but rather a source of resources for public purposes… as Alexander Hamilton said, a national blessing…. Second… no matter what the level of interest rates, you are better confronting your debt-financing problems by rapidly returning the economy to a high-pressure state after a deep recession. Yes, you will have to incur additional debt to give the economy the fiscal spending boost…. But if you do not rapidly return to full employment, then you will be stuck attempting to finance your current debt on the basis of the lessened fiscal capacity of an economy permanently depressed well below the previous normal…




Worthy Reads from Elsewhere:

1. This is very well worth reading from Jason and Larry. Why it is not conventional wisdom now is something I do not understand. Why it was not conventional wisdom a decade ago is something I do not understand. Why it was not the background belief of the Obama administration is something I do not understand:

**Jason Furman & Lawrence Summers**: _A Reconsideration of Fiscal Policy in the Era of Low Interest Rates_ <https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/furman-summers2020-12-01paper.pdf>: ‘Fiscal policy must play a crucial role in stabilization policy in a world where monetary policy can counteract financial instability but otherwise is largely “pushing on a string” when it comes to accelerating economic growth…. In a world of unused capacity and very low interest rates and costs of capital, concerns about crowding out of desirable private investment that were warranted a generation ago have much less force today…. Debt-to-GDP ratios are a misleading metric of fiscal sustainability…. Current debt levels are at low rather than high levels relative to calculations of the present value of GDP or prospective tax receipts…. Traditional notions of financial responsibility for households and businesses hold that borrowing in order to invest in assets that have a return well in excess of the cost of borrowing increases creditworthiness and benefits future stakeholders…. Borrowing to finance appropriate categories of Federal expenditure pays for itself in Federal budgetary terms on reasonable assumptions…



2. David Leonhardt is one of the few reporters at the _New York Times_ covering the government who actually understands the stakes involved in government policy. I had hopes a decade and a half ago that competition from new modes would move the _New York Times_ political reporters off of doing celebrity journalism, but covering ugly people. Those hopes were vain—except for David, and a few others: 

**David Leonhardt**: _Why Economists Support More Stimulus_ <https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/briefing/iran-nuclear-trump-speech-steelers.html>: ‘Moody’s Analytics forecasts that without more aid, the economy will fall into a new recession early next year, with the unemployment rate approaching 10 percent. And Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, has said that the history of economic crises suggests Congress usually passes too little stimulus, not too much. “Some fiscal support now would really help,” Powell told a Senate committee this week…



3. The more I see come down the pike and the older I get, the more I think I should have been listening much more carefully to Jared Bernstein a long time ago. Competitive equilibrium theories of the wage distribution appear to me to be overwhelmingly bankrupt. Business-cycle pressure and then institutional inertia seem to me to play significantly larger roles:

**Jared Bernstein**: _The Importance of a Wage-Growth Agenda_ <https://twitter.com/econjared/status/1333076976198971394>: ‘Persistent full employment raises real pay through the worker-power channel. In recent decades, I think of the 1990s and 2010s the cycles that got to and stayed at full emp for a good bit…. The relationship between the unemployment rate and mid-level real hourly wage levels… is non-linear at high unemp, but the gains are clear. I've argued the benefits are strong on both demand and supply sides and equitable, especially by race…. Only getting to and staying at chock full employment makes a real difference. In this regard, the Fed's recent data-driven (vs. estimate-of-natural-rate driven) [policy turn is] VERY important.



4. The U.S. government displaying amazing degrees of total incompetence. The Wuhan lockdown—the fact that China regarded it as necessary, and its success—should have colored all thinking about coronavirus last winter at the CDC and elsewhere. And it did not: 

**Dan Vergano & Zahra Hirji**: _Coronavirus: How The CDC Lost Control Of The Pandemic_ <https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/cdc-coronavirus-containment-redfield>: ‘The world’s premier health agency pushed a flawed coronavirus containment strategy—until it disappeared from public view one day before the outbreak was declared a pandemic. On January 17, the... Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced it was screening travelers from Wuhan, China, because of a new infectious respiratory illness striking that city.... “Based on the information that CDC has today, we believe the current risk from this virus to the general public is low,” said Nancy Messonnier, the CDC’s director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.... The information the CDC had on January 17 was wrong... because China’s leaders withheld what they already knew... because Trump administration officials had cut CDC staffers in Beijing... because past coronavirus outbreaks provided a false guide.... That last reason—a fateful misjudgment of the basic biology of the virus—drove a flawed strategy to contain the outbreak. In 17 press briefings from January to March, the agency pushed the idea that if travelers, first from Wuhan and then from China, were quickly identified, traced, and isolated, it could “slow and reduce” the spread of the virus on US soil. Believing people without symptoms didn't spread the virus, the agency limited testing, discouraged masking, and left the country blinded by a faulty COVID-19 test. Then, when the containment strategy's failure became undeniable, just one day before the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic—the CDC disappeared from public view.... The US response has been a disaster across the federal government, with the CDC the most visible face of failure.... At that first CDC coronavirus briefing, Messonnier explained what two other coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, could tell us about how to contain the mysterious new virus. And she described the crux of their containment plan: stopping the disease from entering the US by screening for travelers with a fever and a cough, testing them, and putting sick people in isolation.... We now know that COVID-19 patients have the heaviest viral load—and appear most infectious—at the onset of symptoms, not at the end. People who haven’t yet developed any symptoms, and therefore wouldn’t show up in the CDC’s temperature checks, are responsible for more than 40% of the virus’s spread. And only about 45% of cases early in an infection will develop a fever.... The travel bans by themselves were a Band-Aid on a dam about to burst, only helpful when paired with public health agencies performing widespread testing and isolating infected patients—both with and without symptoms. That didn’t happen.... Meissonier’s “next pandemic” statement should have triggered action across the federal government, Frieden, the former CDC director, told BuzzFeed News. “That's the point at which Iceland and Korea and Germany and a bunch of other countries got the private sector commercial laboratories into scaling up test production, ventilator production, respirators, protective equipment production,” he said. But that didn’t happen. The next two months would make this failure clear.... As the virus began to spread in the US, a dire lack of testing defined the month of February, driven by mistakes at the health agency.... Following the CDC’s playbook on flu pandemics, Messonnier discouraged the public from using face masks, echoing similar advice from the WHO and US Surgeon General Jerome Adams. Since masks were thought to prevent the transmission of a virus from coughing, health officials feared a run on surgical masks would keep them from reaching vulnerable public health workers in hospitals, where most infectious patients driving a coronavirus outbreak would be located. In April, facing increasing pressure from public health experts, the CDC urged Americans to don cloth masks, citing the asymptomatic transmission risk first noted by Redfield and Fauci at the end of January. But the damage was done: Months later, the initial confusion over the utility of widespread use of face coverings has only made masks more of a political flashpoint.... In her opening remarks at a fateful CDC briefing on February 25, Messonnier finally dropped any pretense that the US would not suffer from the outbreak. “You should ask your children’s school about their plans for school dismissals or school closures,” she said. “You should think about what you would do for childcare if schools or daycares close, if teleworking is an option for you.” The remarks set off a news firestorm, which, combined with a stock market drop, reportedly enraged President Donald Trump. The next day, he replaced Azar with Vice President Mike Pence as chair of his coronavirus task force, which began daily briefings that would soon replace the CDC’s. "It's going to disappear. One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear," Trump said on February 27, at a Black History Month reception.... On February 29... Washington state officials reported the first suspected US death from COVID-19, of a man in his fifties.... They also reported the first outbreak in a nursing home, the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington.... Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency.... Asked on the day of the Life Care Center report whether nursing homes should be closed, Messonnier replied, “Right now, we still judge the general risk to the American public to be low, and that includes residents of long-term care facilities.”... Nursing home residents would eventually account for about 40% of coronavirus deaths in the US.... Messonnier put the blame on doctors. “CDC’s criteria for patients under investigation has always started with the importance of astute clinicians who are making judgments about what their patients are likely to have,” she said on March 3. “So we’ve always allowed those patients to be part of the testing criteria.”... On March 10, Messonnier reported that the US had more than 500 confirmed cases. “This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person based on the available data,” she said. The assessment was a complete reversal of the information the agency had at its first briefing less than two months earlier. This would also be the last time the CDC addressed the public until June.... Since March, as case counts climbed to more than 2 million, blame for the US’s failure to keep the coronavirus contained—when countries like South Korea, Germany, and even China succeeded—has extended far beyond the CDC. The Trump administration has blamed China... and the WHO.... Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, paints a picture of White House officials uninterested in ramping up the production of medical equipment.... Azar was blamed for not coordinating efforts at the CDC and the FDA, leaving the botched test the only one available, and for overselling his agency’s efforts to Trump.... “One of the things I find so puzzling is you see mistake after mistake after mistake, one right another,” said Harvard global health professor Ashish Jha. “My sense is that all of these people knew things were going very badly. But none of them had the courage to speak up at the White House and push for an adequate federal response. “Sure, the biology of the virus made it harder; this isn’t SARS,” he added. “But it wasn't impossible to contain.”... On June 12, after more than 113,000 Americans had died in the pandemic, the CDC held its first briefing in three months. In a presentation by CDC Director Redfield, he shared the agency’s recommendations for lowering the risk of infection as states begin to reopen. Along with the CDC’s Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases, he emphasized staying 6 feet apart, washing hands, and wearing cloth masks. The pair deflected questions on whether the guidelines applied to mass rallies announced by the president’s reelection campaign. Asked about the surges in cases currently hitting states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas, Butler suggested it could be explained by a rise in testing, a suggestion Fauci would dismiss in a congressional hearing two weeks later. Messonnier was not on the call...



5. And now for something completely different: literary art reflecting on the human condition, and also powerfully reflecting upon the public order and history of humanity in our times: 

**Simon Schama**: _What Makes John le Carré a Writer of Substance_ <https://www.ft.com/content/04df988d-9b09-4e6a-b7d8-70b1a5e654dc>: ‘Someone, sometime, had to translate Dean Acheson’s famous 1962 characterisation of a Britain that had “lost an empire but has not yet found a role” into literature. But until le Carré came along, no writer had nailed the toxic combination of bad faith and blundering, the confusion of tactical cynicism with strategic wisdom, with such lethal accuracy.... His writing did... have some precedents.... He belonged to the same “lower-upper-middle-class” as George Orwell.... Like Orwell... le Carré had a pitch-perfect ear for the disingenuous hypocrisies sustaining those who mistook “Getting Away with It” for national purpose. Le Carré’s other literary pedigree... came from Anthony Trollope: the shrewd sense that institutions had collective personalities and psychologies, as if they were extended families. As such, they were the theatre of deadly, high-stakes dramas of loyalty and betrayal…



6. Well, it looks like this week I could only play my position for four of my eight “worthy reads from elserwhere”, doesn’t it? Francis Fukuyama is always worth reading. And it is very important to follow him as he tries to guide our thinking about how to avoid the greatest catastrophe that faces us—that our generation might destroy the very precious heritage of democracy we have inherited, and fail to pass it down: 

**Francis Fukuyama**: _The State of Democracy in 2020 & Beyond_ <https://www.wsj.com/articles/francis-fukuyama-on-the-state-of-democracy-in-2020-and-beyond-11608051600>: ‘There is reason to hope that our descent may yet begin to turn around.... While many Republicans continue to contest the legitimacy of the vote, Joe Biden will almost certainly be sworn in as president on Jan. 20 and will immediately begin to repair some of the damage.... One of the big misunderstandings of the Covid crisis is the notion that authoritarian governments necessarily do better in fighting disease than democracies.... Any number of democracies, from South Korea and Taiwan to New Zealand, Canada and Germany have done as well or better than China in containing the disease. And mainstream democratic leaders like Korea’s Moon Jae-in, Germany’s Angela Merkel or New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern have been rewarded in recent votes or poll numbers for their effective handling of the crisis.... People around the world are fearful, insecure and unhappy, and that is not a formula for political stability. But we would do well to remember that prior crises at times brought about positive change by exposing the failures of bad leaders and creating demand for reform. While democracy has its discontents, there has been continuing popular pushback against abusive and/or corrupt governments world-wide as people vote or take to the streets…



7. How a very few made Trump work for them, and for their goals: 

**Tim O'Brien**: _Trump Strutted Like a Player, But Barr, McConnell and Powell Played Him_ <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-14/trump-strutted-like-a-player-but-barr-mcconnell-and-powell-played-him>: ‘On the policy frontier... others were in charge... people most likely regarded Trump as a useful foil, someone easy to manipulate or outmaneuver if you had the stomach and patience for it... Mitch McConnell... William Barr and... Chair Jerome Powell.... They could be wily (McConnell, Barr, Powell), craven (McConnell, Barr) or courageous (Powell), but needed at least one of those attributes.... “At the risk of tooting my own horn, look at the majority leaders since L.B.J. and find another one who was able to do something as consequential as this,” McConnell, a history buff, told the New York Times after he rammed Justice Amy Coney Barrett onto the Supreme Court in October. McConnell regards his conservative reshaping of the federal judiciary as his signature accomplishment.... McConnell, according to those close to him, held Trump in low regard but protected him anyway to feed his own political ambitions.... It’s not clear yet whether McConnell, content to wield power for power’s sake alone, will pay any penalties for cuddling with Trump... Barr, who, when asked last year whether his ward-heeler’s advocacy for Trump has tainted his legacy and his reputation in the legal community, responded with trademark indifference: “I’m at the end of my career.… Everyone dies.”... Barr helped Trump end-run Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, gave Trump the latitude to misuse federal force on U.S. streets, helped protect White House advisers on the wrong side of the law, knee-capped federal prosecutors investigating matters close to Trump and helped give early credence to Trump’s claims that the presidential election was rigged before later reversing himself.... Trump harbored authoritarian designs well before he intersected with Barr, but it’s Barr who tried to build a throne for the president—and taught Trump how to go about it. Powell... is the brighter tale here.... Trump has repeatedly tried to strong-arm during his presidency. “Who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” Trump once asked. Powell endured all of this with great calm and confidence,... Powell’s tenure is a reminder that Trump can’t corrupt people willy-nilly. They have to be primed for it beforehand. And bad things didn’t happen during Trump’s time in office because he landed in Washington with a fully realized plan. Bad outcomes took root because Trump was surrounded by bad actors, some of whom knew exactly how to play him…



8. The _National Review_ has not dared to be too anti-Trump for a long, long time. Here they wonder if they can get back into the water, and dip their toe in to see what will happen. Will they lose massive numbers of readers? They are ready to turn tail and run back to the Trumpist corner if they get the wrong reaction. But they are nearly unique among those who are still Republicans in even being willing to dip their toe into the water:

**National Review**: _Trump Election Fraud Allegations Disgraceful Endgame to 2020 Reelection Effort_ https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/11/trump-election-fraud-disgraceful-endgame/: ‘The president can’t stand to admit that he lost and so has insisted since the wee hours of Election Night that he really won—and won “by a lot.” There are legitimate issues to consider after the 2020 vote about the security of mail-in ballots and the process of counting votes... but make no mistake: The chief driver of the post-election contention of the past several weeks is the petulant refusal of one man to accept the verdict of the American people. The Trump team (and much of the GOP) is working backwards, desperately trying to find something, anything to support the president’s aggrieved feelings, rather than objectively considering the evidence and reacting as warranted. Almost nothing that the Trump team has alleged has withstood the slightest scrutiny. In particular, it’s hard to find much that is remotely true in the president’s Twitter feed these days.... Flawed and dishonest assertions like this pollute the public discourse and mislead good people who make the mistake of believing things said by the president of the United States....  It’s his legal right to file suits, of course, but he shouldn’t pursue meritless litigation in Hail Mary attempts to get millions of votes tossed out. This is exactly what he’s been doing, it’s why reputable GOP lawyers have increasingly steered clear, and it’s why Trump has suffered defeat after defeat in court.... Trump’s most reprehensible tactic has been to attempt, somewhat shamefacedly, to get local Republican officials to block the certification of votes and state legislatures to appoint Trump electors... It’s a profoundly undemocratic move that we hope no losing presidential candidate ever even thinks of again…
