Let me begin by offering a very brief precis of what I understood Professor Goodhart to be saying. He focused on the structural factors driving inflationary pressures. Times of hyperglobalization, in which the world's international division of labor changes and deepens, are times in which there are deflationary pressures—so many opportunities to lower costs are being grabbed. Times in which the world economy's global division of labor is more or less static tend to be times of inflationary pressures. Times in which demands on governments are relatively stable are times of neutrality. But times in which demands on governments undergo structural increases—inflation and seigniorage are ways of raising money, and inevitably as governments try to meet the commitments that their electorates demand they resort to them at some point at some time to some degree.

For example, during the Second Hundred Years, from the coup of William of Orange in 1688 on up through the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, the British government faced the extraordinary demands from the financing required for the British Imperial fiscal-military state. And in the years after World War II you had the expansion of the social-insurance state. Those were both sources of structural inflationary pressure. From 1980 on up to very recently, Goodhart is saying, hyperglobalization has been putting deflationary pressure on the world economy. That is now coming to an end. And the aging of society is going to put enormous structural-inflationary pressures on global-north governments. I agree with all of this.

But—even though it is always very intellectually hazardous to disagree with Charles Goodhart: people who do so usually wind up embarrassed and apologizing three years later—I find myself thinking that while these structural pressures on inflation are there, they are second-order. The first-order factors for the next generation are much more the monetary and the macro and the expectational. Why? Because in our age the inflation rate is an explicit target of central banks and governments in a way that it was not up until, say, 1980 or so. That makes a difference: central banks focus on neutralizing the structural factors, and are able to do so. 

Even earlier, structural factors could be overwhelmed by substantial changes in monetary affairs. The discovery of massive amounts of extremely low-quality gold in the Witwatersrand made a huge difference, once that had triggered the construction of both a modern railroad from the Natal coast to transport it and a world-class frontier organic chemistry industry in Johannesberg to process it. The deflationary pressures of the late 1800s came to a sudden end, and from 1896 on the world economy shifted into an inflationary boom

Now, having spent half my time commenting on what the other panelist had to say, let me turn to answering the question I was posed, which was: Will there be inflation?

There will be inflation. Right now we are attempting to rejoin traffic at speed. Here in the United States we are convincing 10 million workers to rejoin the labor force. Here in the United States we are convincing 500,000 employers to employ them. Furthermore, we need to move 4% of the labor force across sectors because we are going to have a much more online and more last-mile distribution-heavy economy in the future than we had in the past. Significant relative wage differentials in favor of expanding sectors will be needed to pull workers in. Because of the psychological impossibility of cutting nominal wages in modern economies—this has been the case for a century or so—higher real wages in growing sectors means rising wages overall. Moreover, there are lots of reopening supply bottlenecks. Most of those bottlenecks will kind of show up as supply shortages and much longer delivery times: the world auto companies are not paying other chip customers for their places in line for the chips coming out of TSMC, Samsung, and company, but are waiting their turn, yelling for political help, and smiling because the chip supply shortage with available chips parceled out in proportion to demand has accidentally allowed them to collude and raise prices. Not all of the reopening bottlenecks are showing up as delays and shortages. Some will show up in higher prices. And that will produce inflation?

How much inflation? We do not know. We have never tried to do anything like this before—so much, so fast, perhaps five times the scale of the largest previous structural adjustment. Assuming that relationships are linear is an extremely bad thing to assume when we are so far out of previous experience. There will be inflation for the next year and a half.

How persistent will the inflation be? Will it continue into 2023 and beyond? My guess, and it is just a guess, is that it will not. It took many repeated substantial shocks to de-anchor inflation expectations over 1965-75 to create the inflation we saw in the late 1970s. We are unlikely to have such a series of shocks. And in the absence of such a series that de-anchors expectations, the Phillips curve is and has been relatively flat. 

Economists have been going back over the experience of the 1960s and the 1970s. The most impressive piece I have seen is by Emi Nakamura and John Steinsson, both of whom Berkeley stole from Columbia three years ago. They took a look at whether the Phillips curve was flat or steep in the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s. They came up with the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that while the Phillips curve was quite steep at the macro level, with relatively small changes in employment and unemployment leading to substantial changes in inflation, it was very flat at the micro state and the city level, with an excess supply or an excess demand for labor in a particular city or a particular state having very little impact on the prices of non-tradables and the wages of people in those states and cities.

This points strongly to the nationwide formation of expectations and the impact of expectations of inflation on inflation outcomes as the dominant factors. People mark up their demands for wages and their plans for prices according to what they think the average rate of inflation is going to be. And actual supply-and-demand pressure cause only small deviations from those plans. At the moment it looks like inflation expectations have for a generation been very stable—highly anchored. People see year-to-year movements in inflation, but they do not incorporate those movements into their expectations. Rather, they expect inflation to revert to its past mean value. Thus people have strong confidence in central banks. As long as that confidence in central banks lasts, the inflation we will see over the next year and a half will not lead to higher inflation in 2023 and beyond. We will be burning rubber, leaving skid marks on the road as we enter traffic at speed. We will not boil over and melting our economic engine.

Let me stop there.

====

We economists are stuck now where we have been since the late 1930s, when Ragnar Nurkse looked back over the preceding 50 years, and the concluded that much depended on whether expectations were mean-reverting or extrapolative. Countries in which people thought that exchange rates and inflation rates and price levels would return to normal had enormous freedom of action in their policies, and could conduct extraordinary successful economic stabilization campaigns. Countries in which expectations became extrapolative—ones in which a decline in the value of the currency now led people to think it is likely to decline further and we need to sell, in which people think that inflation now means not just inflation but higher inflation next year—had no good options. I think Nurkse's insight is true. Our problem is that we have nothing good coming from either psychology or economics as to when such expectational shift of régime takes place. We can point to individual historical examples: Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration, the Volcker disinflation, Francois Mitterands declarations that he was going to reflate the French economy which led to an outburst of inflation even before he was elected and left him with no good policy options in the late 1970s.

One thought: we look at our financial markets, and we see that right now participation and engagement appears to be, to put it politely, highly elastic. The comments of Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live and of participants in Reddit forums can cause massive and immediate divergences between prices and fundamental values—divergences that shock investors and traders who I would have thought were very well-informed and cautious in their hedging. A market as "frothy" as the financial markets we seem to be building today on top of social media—those are ones in which extrapolative expectations, and thus loss of the ability to successfully stabilize, are more likely.

====

It took a decade, starting with Lyndon Johnson's calling William McChesney Martin into the Oval Office in 1966 to ask him not to raise interest rates just then, and ending with the very overoptimistic decisions of the Ford Treasury and of the Burns Federal Reserve after the 1975 recession that expectations were normal and that reflation was appropriate. I feel as though things are about as well anchored now as they were in 1965. That means that if we get through this wave by 2024, things are likely to go back to normal—except for all the structural factors that Professor Goodhart emphasized.

====

I would point out that there is an awful lot of inertia in nominal long rates. If there is a single regularity in the long bond market over the United States over the past 70 years, it is that it is very difficult to get bond traders as a group to very quickly revise their anchor points as to what these things should be selling for. During the run-up of inflation from 1965 to 1981, bond traders appear to have been at least half-oblivious to what was happening. After the Volcker disinflation, anchor points in bond markets kept long-term real interest rates at extraordinarily high levels for a full generation. I think Professor Goodhart is right: tapering is likely to be the first thing that centra. But even so, the nominal long bond rate is likely to remain substantially anchored for a decade—which would then lead one to expect a decade or so of even lower real long rates than we have now, hard as that may be to believe.

====

Can the Fed stop inflation? It definitely can. And I think it will: it has ever since 1979. Before then, it required a very strange concatenation of events for the Fed not to stop inflation from 1969 to 1979. I have been powerfully influenced by Arthur Burns's late-1950s presidential address to the American Economic Association. He contrasted the old business cycle in which governments did not take strong action to boost the economy out of a recession with the new one. In the old business cycle, labor union demands for wage increases were always greatly curbed by the fact that having high wages would make its members' jobs an obvious target when the inevitable big recession came. But, Burns said, we live in this new business cycle in which people expect the government to prevent large downturns, Thus there are no curbs on labor union wage demands. Inflation is then not a problem that can be solved by economic means. It has to be solved by political means—congress has to do it. Moreover Arthur Burns thought, the independence of the Fed is a very important thing. It will not survive if Congress believes that the Fed deliberately triggered a deep recession. These all are the reasons that led Arthur Burns to make his 180-degree turn at the start of the 1970s, to oppose his long-time patron, the guy who had appointed him, President Richard Nixon, and begin calling for wage and price controls. That was a very surprising thing for a central banker to do.

But you needed more than Burns to get the inflation of the 1970s. You also needed Richard Nixon and John Connally, who broke the Bretton Woods system because, as their then-underling Paul Volcker said, they were both strongly in favor of bold action but had no preferences as to what or in which direction the action should be bold. You had to add a strong union movement both in the United States and Britain—less so in the rest of Europe—that did really not understand the stakes and did not realize that the continuation of a labor-relations system quite congenial to them depended on their willingness to exercise wage restraint and so assist governments keep inflation from rising. Add in the 2.5%-point/year slowdown in productivity growth in the early 1970s. Add in King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. All of those things had to be working against the normal culture of central banks and inflation control for 1969-1979 to happen. I do not see the very same, a similar, very strange concatenation of events coming in the next decade. I think in the medium run of three to four years, Fed culture—which Jay Powell is pushing the limits of—will reassert itself inside the Eccles building. The Federal Reserve will do what it takes to keep inflation from continually overshooting its target—2%/year for the PCE deflator, which means something like 2.5%/year for the core CPI.

====

Yes, being a central banker is going to be very difficult over the next 10 years. But when has it not been very difficult? In the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan and company had only either good options or better options, because the world economy was stable and they had considerable help from the U.S. administration headed by Bill Clinton which was aggressively interested in long-run fiscal stabilization and  solvency. Lloyd Bentsen and Robert Rubin were Secretaries of the Treasury, and were eager to make the Fed's job much easier, and worked hard and spend political capital to accomplish that. That was about the only decade in which being a central banker was a fun and a happy experience.

That was about the only decade in which being a central banker was a fun and a happy experience.

Yes, debt levels are—I won't say unprecedented, certainly Britain after the Napoleonic Wars had a much larger debt overhang in proportion to GDP—. But counterbalancing that is the extraordinary willingness of and in fact eager demand by investors around the world for safe assets, which they define as the liabilities of governments that possess exorbitant privilege on a large scale—issuing their own debt to add to the world stock of reserves, and then rolling over that stock at interest rates less than the growth rate of the economy as a whole. It is very close to being a free lunch for Britain, for the European Union, for Japan, for the United States—and possibly soon for China—to issue debt.

Normally, when you borrow or when you accept deposits, you have to pay people interest for the use of their money. But Britain, the EU, Japan and the US are instead, effectively charging their lenders fees for keeping their money and wealth safe and liquid.That is and has been the situation for the past 15 years. How long will this last? No one can tell. But as long as it lasts, the market economy is telling us that, worldwide, investors regard the debts of the countries with exorbitant privilege as extraordinarily valuable assets. In a market economy you have very strong incentives if you can—you become healthy and wealthy, and people think you wise if you do—create incredibly valuable assets.

What worries me is the extremely short duration of all of these governments' debts. I really wish that the treasuries were testing the market by attempting substantial increases in average debt maturity. I still do not understand why Janet Yellen isn't issuing both a nominal and a inflation-indexed consol right now, and seeing what the market for those things are. That would bring us a great deal of valuable information about what the available space for fiscal management is that we do not now have.

Hi everyone. And welcome to the second event. Final 2021. And I'm an analyst in the healthcare team and I'm joined by my colleagues, Patrick and Greg to host a discussion. So today we'd like all to welcome two esteemed guests to have what will be a long discussion or perhaps the most pertinent question to the market at the moment. What is the outlook inflation? So today's debate, we'll be spending to two during the first section, we'll discuss [inaudible] drivers and what we should expect to see in the coming months and years, and the second most role that there was a Q and a box. So please do post your questions and we'll try to get to as many as we can. If during off to the debate, we also have a raffle for this. You can join live twin some, some sweet photos [inaudible] at the time. And then when I announced the five minutes of that at the end. So given the business debate, we are keen to test the temperature before and after the discussion. So in a moment, I'll have David [inaudible].

Speaker 2:
I do that at Patrick and I we'd like to introduce our two guest speakers. So first guest is professor Charles co-taught. There is diving itself, professor Decata, hasn't done. So then on the policy side as a monetary economist at the bank of England, maybe two decades. And so he it out as well. And on the academic side as professor of banking and finance, and then on the school of economics, where he remains in artist, professor Britain pointing on not to surrounding monetary policy, central banking and macro economics and [inaudible] council, his latest book, the break decrepit, which contains many on this actual we'll delve into today has been described school provoking and applying [inaudible] experiences to no mics.

Speaker 1:
I'll be able to cut this off and get straight to the point.

Speaker 3:
And for that, I was thinking guests today, it provides a broad day long distinguished Mako economist from UC Berkeley as a debit [inaudible], I'm playing on a rogue and Tucker into Mexico. [inaudible] most reasonably seamless. Previously previous fiscal policy, that paper was large, so much [inaudible] although was mentioning, right? I love the most on the paper with vendor cyber directionality, which is also timely topic, but we will, we will welcome both professor [inaudible] on compression, practition and overdue.

Speaker 3:
Thank you very much country. So Sam, you said in places when you pay $15 for the 10 to one ad costs that you used to get from $5 when you have to have, so almost everyone can see that there's currently some transitioning inflation is B from, from, from kind of a good question to today's. Does this assist, or does it go back to historical wounds you as consumer pricing place, the average, just to a 2% deposit that T is although it's tended to people, learned it as novels and she had speed era [inaudible] five years from today is Carney sitting around 2.4%. And so the first question we're going to ask everyone is, do you expect us inflation in a 10 year era to, since bats above its long-term average of 2%, 2.2 by four, we'll hold this up for a 20, 20 seconds. You should see on your screen. Show me Great. And so the second question is what level would inflation have to get to for you to want to sell financial assets, your favorite, typical stools and values such as gold and commodities. So there you have the second second some questions shortly.

Speaker 1:
Okay. No

Speaker 4:
Consequences in seconds. Great. So what we're going to share the results at the end of the session. So thank you.

Speaker 2:
[Inaudible] Opening statements. So I the patient outlook [inaudible]

Speaker 4:
[Inaudible] two, three days time, I'll start by saying that of the low inflation over recent decades is lot to better monetary policy with central bank independence and inflation target. So I didn't ask everything to monetary policy because the central bankers haven't really had to work very hard to gain inflation down to, or even below in recent years, inflation target. That means they haven't had to raise interest rates at anytime very sharply. And during the years, since 1998, the years of inflation target trade, please interest rates based and real intending between. So there has been some underlying disinflationary factors, which are reduced the, in the context in which we are working, maybe thirst inclusionary. Now we believe that the main factor bringing her back disinflation has been the massive increase. I think we've had in the demography and in verbalization resonates side. Geez, we have the next slide please.

Speaker 4:
Well, I'll go on India. I that's, I, for very much, no, the blue line represents the working age population are those in the advanced economies, primarily North America in Europe, the other line, which is above it represents the working age population in China and Eastern Europe, which joined the world's trading system during this period. And China is the most populous country in the world. And you can see the breadth of blue line and the airlines were revising reasonably rapidly from the start of the period in 1988 up to about 2010 more rumor since China and Eastern Europe growing the world's trading system. Anyone who could move that the production from the high wage to the low wage areas was able and keen to do so. And that meant that there was an enormous shift of manufacturing from the highways to the lower wage areas.

Speaker 4:
And this had a number of disinflationary forces. First of all, the move to the production, to the low wage areas, cheaper the production of manufacturers [inaudible] be moved in that direction. Secondly, the option to move production to a low wage center act as a threat against people wanting higher wages, asking for high wages in the advanced economies and third year, or was it led to a shift of all the production in the advanced economies around manufacturing to services and services. I am actually part of a labor unions to organize and therefore the power and spraying and membership of trade, private sector, credit unions, and the advanced economies as declined strongly during these years effectively. This is [inaudible].

Speaker 4:
So there was no one in any increase in the proportion of those in working age population and also the next dark. And we have the next slide is is that the reason why the working age population is Bruce who rapid game was that the birth rate went down after the baby boom and that combined with the availability consumer durables, washing machines, refrigeration, and so on meant that women of working age, who previously worked at him and whose home production was not GED now entered into the workforce and began working in many large numbers. So the, it was only that there was a massive awkward shift as a proportion of working age population, but the number of workers, particularly women workers of that working age population, where we're even more strongly work has by definition, a disinflationary, since you can't a real work, unless you pay them less than the production that you expect them the value of the production that you expect them to bring them back.

Speaker 4:
So every increasing portion of workers, the population is deserved visionary where non-work is particularly dependency on and they retired since they consume, but they do produce are by definition inflationary and is particularly the case that it is the old more inflationary. And we are the next slide, please. Not so much because we are old and I am owed myself, actually consume more in the way goods and services. There is a working age, but unfortunately, an increasing proportion, the proportion of us [inaudible] diseases, Parkinson's and dementia, and we need care. And it is the care that we need. And the medicines that we need that actually provide the greatest proportion of the extra expenditure that is required for the L. And we'll go on now, this means that particularly since subject true expenditure around care and medicine, it's very largely provided by the state by the government, but these is having an major long-term structural effect on the deficit and debt of the government itself. So we have the next slide, please.

Speaker 4:
And now you see the CBO projection, given current policies all of what is likely to happen to the U S public sector debt ratio. And I can say that you will see that the pandemic and every reduced a bit, but it was AMIA. The real underlying problem is the worst thing, age structure with a much larger proportion of the agent after the pandemic is there, we will see the continuing exponential rise and the expected that debt, different prison policies, that there was a structure we'll figure your back, which is absolutely nothing. No, it is true. Of course, that was much higher at times in the past Wars war wearable, but it was saying God, a timber ran after that. You expect fiscal and monetary policies to go back to gold. But the problem is that this is structural and it's not going to go away.

Speaker 4:
The problem is when we read the book was that we did not know the way possible minus five years. When did the long-term trend affect the momentum from the shift demography, liberalization for being favorable, moved to be much less favorable. For example, when the increasing struggle, the three bus giant and the effect of the pandemic and frigging unified basis, it designs for self-sufficiency. We didn't know where the momentum would change and bringing a bike, any increase in underlying wages, but then the convince truck. And we believe that the effect of the COVID the convict together, the pandemic together with the policies that are being introduced to deal with it, and its aftermath will have the effect of accelerating the shift from the D stationary decades or disinflationary decades from 1998 and the five, 2010 to the more inflationary decades that we expect to happen from a bag now over the next three or four decades.

Speaker 4:
And that is, can we have an eight slide these in the core product, because what you see is much freight on increase in a, in, in short run effect on inflation with a massive increase in monetary growth. You can see on the left hand side, how do you as monetary, various has rocketed upwards and is still rocketing upwards. And the Phillips curve and unemployment is as the, in timber rarer the high it will start reversing really very shortly and we already have supply shortages beginning to strike in America. So there is bound to be a flood because of the supply shortages is likely to be rather stronger. The fed says thought, and even then when we get into the next year credit credit to where the supply shortages will hopefully begin to relax, we will, at the same time have an increase in the employment levels.

Speaker 4:
So the Phillips curve will begin to bat back, come back in the combination of the continuing expansion, monetary prays over two years together with the recovery in employment, Bibles and reduction in, on, in private and all of that will, you know, have you mean that I try to cater? I do too. We'll continue to be as inflationary as trying to do. One is now I'm starting to become by the time these two years have gone through inflation expectations, which are generally backwards, we'll have almost certainly ceased to be sort of in the quite well anchored. And by that time we think that that combined with a shift in demography and in globalization, the, the changing underlying trends that now exist to our economies in all our economies will start to mean that the inflationary pressures will be back and we'll be back on a much more regular basis than we had before COVID struck and the policies to deal with it had been introduced. So that's my initial position.

Let me begin by offering a very brief precis of what I understood Professor Goodhart to be saying. He focused on the structural factors driving inflationary pressures. Times of hyperglobalization, in which the world's international division of labor changes and deepens, are times in which there are deflationary pressures—so many opportunities to lower costs are being grabbed. Times in which the world economy's global division of labor is more or less static tend to be times of inflationary pressures. Times in which demands on governments are relatively stable are times of neutrality. But times in which demands on governments undergo structural increases—inflation and seigniorage are ways of raising money, and inevitably as governments try to meet the commitments that their electorates demand they resort to them at some point at some time to some degree.

That makes a difference: central banks focus on neutralizing the structural factors, and are able to do so. 

Even earlier, structural factors could be overwhelmed by substantial changes in monetary affairs. The discovery of massive amounts of extremely low-quality gold in the Witwatersrand made a huge difference, once that had triggered the construction of both a modern railroad from the Natal coast to transport it and a world-class frontier organic chemistry industry in Johannesberg to process it. The deflationary pressures of the late 1800s came to a sudden end, and from 1896 on the world economy shifted into an inflationary boom

Not all of the reopening bottlenecks are showing up as delays and shortages. Some will show up in higher prices. And that will produce inflation?

Let me stop there.

====

Thank you professor at all. Definitely a lot to unpack in, in both of those opening statements. Again, I'm not from I don't audience to submit any questions they might have for the Q and a box. But I'll hand over to, to Patrick for the moderator discussion.

Speaker 6:
Thank you. And same to you professor go home and professor [inaudible] very interesting opening statement seems like if you measure the labor market and the trends, maybe we can start with that. If you have there been issues with triathlon system, which growth and inflation big professor tropical hall, we have a question from the audience that the Asian population is inflationary. The why or the Japan, if they're suffering from depression, how would you reconcile the Asian population in countries like China? But it says [inaudible] economies, Japan and us.

Speaker 4:
Thank you very much. Frederick engage Japan was the main problem that we had to meet in order to do with a book and birth in respect to that. And the question about the Phillips, I would say the same thing, which is there's a tendency for economists to use or to focus only on their own country, as large as us or China. And the point of realization is that the Wu's trading system is now global, which is the world. And you cannot just look at the availability of labor, which is zero unemployment in a single country, even as large as one view us. My colleague [inaudible] coined a phrase, which was China, the Phillips curve in Newark, because effectively it was the availability of being able to send doctrine to China that maybe wasn't beyond the employment in the us. Imagine it was the unemployment worldwide, including in China, that actually method and the slopes of the Phillips curve for those exercises, looking at the oldest States with the single country, I sort of abstracted from policy I've generally been infrequently steeper than the overall.

Speaker 4:
So again for I am facade creased. Now the argument which is made sometimes and professor DeLonge meeting, then everything depends on expectations, I think is a terribly we read, nobody knows what the future is going to bring so that most people, when they are ready to buy it, the future actually look to see what has happened in the recent us. And indeed, because things have been so stable and the reason I'll ask the patient is being so they load constant projected that in the future, and then give a few, couple of years of significant inflation pressures coming from all kinds of supply and strengthens and monitoring price shocks. You name it, they're there at the moment and they're rising. And indeed the effect of COVID itself is likely to bring her back by the first in I in, in awkward price, if your hospitality area your in [inaudible] you'll add line or whatever has not been producing any revenue over the last few years, you've run massively into debt.

Speaker 4:
If you can, you're going to raise prices in order to pay off the debt and get safer. So I, the, I guess we rely on peer expectations that bring us back without any bumps along the road, back to low inflation off, we have, the confidence is relatively high. Inflation is in my view, it's wishful thinking you may may come about, right? None of us expert, we, none of us could see into the future. If I could, I wouldn't be talking to you, but you sitting on a Caribbean or Pacific Island, which I would a with loads of beautiful young women, bringing Avery minimize is a wonderful grips. I'm not, which means that I don't know the future and brag made, right. I have these right, because the future that I see is not necessarily going to be such a comfortable future.

====

We economists are stuck now where we have been since the late 1930s, when Ragnar Nurkse looked back over the preceding 50 years, and the concluded that much depended on whether expectations were mean-reverting or extrapolative. Countries in which people thought that exchange rates and inflation rates and price levels would return to normal had enormous freedom of action in their policies, and could conduct extraordinary successful economic stabilization campaigns. Countries in which expectations became extrapolative—ones in which a decline in the value of the currency now led people to think it is likely to decline further and we need to sell, in which people think that inflation now means not just inflation but higher inflation next year—had no good options. I think Nurkse's insight is true. Our problem is that we have nothing good coming from either psychology or economics as to when such expectational shift of régime takes place. We can point to individual historical examples: Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration, the Volcker disinflation, Francois Mitterands declarations that he was going to reflate the French economy which led to an outburst of inflation even before he was elected and left him with no good policy options in the late 1970s.

One thought: we look at our financial markets, and we see that right now participation and engagement appears to be, to put it politely, highly elastic. The comments of Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live and of participants in Reddit forums can cause massive and immediate divergences between prices and fundamental values—divergences that shock investors and traders who I would have thought were very well-informed and cautious in their hedging. A market as "frothy" as the financial markets we seem to be building today on top of social media—those are ones in which extrapolative expectations, and thus loss of the ability to successfully stabilize, are more likely.

====

Speaker 6:
I think very much for the very interesting Stockholm perspective. I think just to tack a little bit on the inflation expectation how is it definitely a part of variable to toggle, but do you, do you and prevent the alcohol? Like how much will the relaxing inflation have to arrive for how much time period before ingredient 20 preexisting inflation competition that we kind of only have after [inaudible] in central banks?

====

It took a decade, starting with Lyndon Johnson's calling William McChesney Martin into the Oval Office in 1966 to ask him not to raise interest rates just then, and ending with the very overoptimistic decisions of the Ford Treasury and of the Burns Federal Reserve after the 1975 recession that expectations were normal and that reflation was appropriate. I feel as though things are about as well anchored now as they were in 1965. That means that if we get through this wave by 2024, things are likely to go back to normal—except for all the structural factors that Professor Goodhart emphasized.

====

Speaker 6:
Pointed to, which are lurking out there by a peer for examination to change. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:
Well, let me try and give you some numbers. I, there was like kiddie of a, to be in place as we came out of the Cobi. And my interpretation of what central bankers were expecting in NEMA around the world was that might go up above 3% [inaudible]. So that is the number only Rose to about 3% with a big three in front of him and stayed Aaron then came down central bankers would play Victor. If the inflation rate went up 4% and stayed that big four in front, then there would be a larger debate, but the central bankers would say, Hey, this is just trans and fake. Trust me, it'll come back. And I think that that would be uncomfortable, but they could live with it. If the patient is significantly above five stays of 80 long period, I think the central bankers will start feeling extremely uncomfortable.

Speaker 4:
And the statement that they're going to stick with the president follows tourism and continuing expansion and new interest rate increases quite quick and they do not do anything. And the invasion rate remains about five rating. Then I think that expectations will start to Bianca white thinking for which will be another back to pushing the central banks in the direction of having to change tack. And since they've been some explicit that they wouldn't change tack to forced to do so quite early on that will reduce the credibility of the confidence that people have and have a few capability of future innovation act to target level without massive, great difficulties and adverse side effects. I'm wondering how, how he, one of the honest answer is the holiday experience and technology all would say is that there's some people gated with a technology like [inaudible] easy low-hanging fruit, vegetable rate AB, and there were others Nielsen and others who were that the best is yet to come with a digitalization. And the honest answer is we do, but there's a big pot.

Speaker 4:
And if you take time to change at all, seriously, the effect of that is to in the short run and in the relatively short run, a significant change from relatively full Palmer to relatively high-cost forms of power and where the real problems is not so much in the production of energy, but in the transmission of energy, from one place to another and its story to dry your batteries. And so you take into a time, time to change. That is another major, my view inflationary factor that is likely to kick it over the next few years, which I has to be put on the table in the balance alongside the potentiality of technology to reduce stationary pressures.

Speaker 2:
And then there's another question from the audience. Is there a scenario where we have a detoxing of real rates and inflation and summarizes and then lots of fools,

Speaker 4:
But if I just continue in the short run what is going to happen is a real rates, again, eight or any patient is rising and the fates of the time being, and you need any other central bank is going to keep the facial, the facial short rates aided about JIRA. So then I think of the short-term real rates are on the way down, but one of the factors that we see happening is the first response of central banks to any worsening of inflationary pressures will be to take it as a Teva. And the long rates will rise relative to short the yield curve or Steven, and what will happen to real rom-com rates depends on the balance between real short rates going down and nominal wrong rates going up. And I wouldn't like all that [inaudible].

====

I would point out that there is an awful lot of inertia in nominal long rates. If there is a single regularity in the long bond market over the United Statesover the past 70 years, it is that it is very difficult to get bond traders as a group to very quickly revise their anchor points as to what these things should be selling for. During the run-up of inflation from 1965 to 1981, bond traders appear to have been at least half-oblivious to what was happening. After the Volcker disinflation, anchor points in bond markets kept long-term real interest rates at extraordinarily high levels for a full generation. I think Professor Goodhart is right: tapering is likely to be the first thing that centra. But even so, the nominal long bond rate is likely to remain substantially anchored for a decade—which would then lead one to expect a decade or so of even lower real long rates than we have now, hard as that may be to believe.

====

Can the Fed stop inflation? It definitely can. And I think it will: it has ever since 1979. Before then, it required a very strange concatenation of events for the Fed not to stop inflation from 1969 to 1979. I have been powerfully influenced by Arthur Burns's late-1950s presidential address to the American Economic Association. He contrasted the old business cycle in which governments did not take strong action to boost the economy out of a recession with the new one. In the old business cycle, labor union demands for wage increases were always greatly curbed by the fact that having high wages would make its members' jobs an obvious target when the inevitable big recession came. But, Burns said, we live in this new business cycle in which people expect the government to prevent large downturns, Thus there are no curbs on labor union wage demands. Inflation is then not a problem that can be solved by economic means. It has to be solved by political means—congress has to do it. Moreover Arthur Burns thought, the independence of the Fed is a very important thing. It will not survive if Congress believes that the Fed deliberately triggered a deep recession. These all are the reasons that led Arthur Burns to make his 180-degree turn at the start of the 1970s, to oppose his long-time patron, the guy who had appointed him, President Richard Nixon, and begin calling for wage and price controls. That was a very surprising thing for a central banker to do.

But you needed more than Burns to get the inflation of the 1970s. You also needed Richard Nixon and John Connally, who broke the Bretton Woods system because, as their then-underling Paul Volcker said, they were both strongly in favor of bold action but had no preferences as to what or in which direction the action should be bold. You had to add a strong union movement both in the United States and Britain—less so in the rest of Europe—that did really not understand the stakes and did not realize that the continuation of a labor-relations system quite congenial to them depended on their willingness to exercise wage restraint and so assist governments keep inflation from rising. Add in the 2.5%-point/year slowdown in productivity growth in the early 1970s. Add in King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. All of those things had to be working against the normal culture of central banks and inflation control for 1969-1979 to happen. I do not see the very same, a similar, very strange concatenation of events coming in the next decade. I think in the medium run of three to four years, Fed culture—which Jay Powell is pushing the limits of—will reassert itself inside the Eccles building. The Federal Reserve will say, we do indeed have to do what it takes to keep inflation from continually overshooting our targets, which are, I point out 2% per year on the personal consumption expenditures deflator, which, because that has a very different mix than does the consumer price index means something like two and a half percent per year on the CPI.

Speaker 4:
Thank you, professor Dylan and professor trough cohart. I remember you have a slide on the UIC dot fascia Mary sites in two days. And then I think it was yesterday safety. I said that innovation is always everywhere. And as I said, that it was in the U S the sixties in the seven days. And I think that he's right, technically yes, the [inaudible] always [inaudible] if he wants a better, they would do so at a enormous cost and cost creasing will raise the point. That is still the look, is that the decorations when Paul Volcker and Ronald Reagan were making the contrary inflationary policies where the order of public tech today was in a [inaudible] view as 10 private sector, nonfinancial corporate debt was also much less than it now is the aftermath of the COVID pending. That means that raising interest rates will have much more and much more immediate things based on the fiscal position with us and the solvency position of large segments of the U S and indeed any advanced economies corporate sector.

Speaker 4:
I sort of likened the future to the fed, having to call along a knife edge Ridge on one side, if it doesn't do enough, it falls off into massive grade, continuing inflation. On the other side of it just does a bit too much with all these additional debt. It fools off into just financial disaster with financial asset prices, collapsing and considerable solvency is among corporates and the recession developing, which wouldn't do anyone any good crawling along at night, they'd reduce them difficult and it's likely lead to very considerable political pressures to doing any more and duly raising interest rates, which may not be enough, like trying to find your way through the light likely scenario two GS when win-win massively in decade and with a lot higher inflation for a couple of years is going to be enormously difficult. Johnny Atlanta, not in the central bank now, I think I wish them every luck that they can have, but I think that the may will find it very good and that the political pressures on them as Lyndon Johnson put political pressure on other birds, is it makes sense.

Speaker 4:
The independence of central banks is not great. And until very recently, central bankers have been the best friends, the secretaries of the treasury because they been pulling the chestnuts out of the fire by reducing interest rates all the time, start raising interest rates, eight politically popular. It's not really not politically popular, but I'm right. It has these fiscal and other effects on corporates. And it's going to be far more difficult in the much more engaged circumstance. We now find ourselves praying about disinflation. Then it was in 1979 and it was difficult enough and it took a nap, political bravery for Paul VOCA and Ronald Reagan to do it. I find it quite difficult to believe. I hope that there will be sufficient political bravery in future. I wait to be, I wait, I wait in the hopes of seeing it

Speaker 6:
One quick followup question here in the interest time. So they seem like central bank hand up pretty high given that that hideout ratio professor transfer heart does that. We people confidence in central banks that affinity to manage the interest rate and the inflation and seem like their confidence is pretty crucial role in inflation expectation.

Speaker 4:
I don't think there's many people will worry about confidence if they find that movie for Intel, you know, chocolate. I do think that there's in corporations, which are highly engaged and they're trying to work a way. So however, the COVID pandemic den or we'll feel confident the, when interest rates are going up you put a bubble self preservation before anything else. So innovation will mean that a lot from people, a large segment of the society will resist any attempt by the fed to raise interest rates under J tapering sufficiently to bring her back the re the reduction of the likely inflationary pressures. Can we see the new to future raising rates as tool to do the thing is they, the worsening of demography and globalization is going to mean that aggregate growth is likely to fall back. We really are fairly confident.

Speaker 4:
Doesn't mean to say that I put a worker when rise, we think it will, but aggregate growth will fall back with the reduction in the growth of the work of the, of the doodle of very afraid of the total workforce. So your greatest, ain't going to do it for you. This isn't going to do it for you while you could raise taxes or tax increasing taxes, drawing on the skater, or the problem is such the idea is you can get around it just by catching the Ridge. It doesn't say the taxation is pretty much broader and has ability dance or using interest rates is political down, hoping that everyone knows it. Inflation is unpopular too, but the problem is that to raise taxes or to raise interest rates compliment, or the central bank has to take an action, which is perceived and is unpopular. What's likely to happen is that everybody, including every secretary of the treasury is going to say we hate inflation, but if they do don't do anything and fashion will occur, and it may be easier for them to do nothing rather than to take the politically unpopular actions, raising interest rates and, or raising taxation, a good deal with the underlying structural problems that are coming down the road

====

Yes, being a central banker is going to be very difficult over the next 10 years. But when has it not been very difficult? In the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan and company had only either good options or better options, because the world economy was stable and they had considerable help from the U.S. administration headed by Bill Clinton which was aggressively interested in long-run fiscal stabilization and  solvency. Lloyd Bentsen and Robert Rubin were Secretaries of the Treasury, and were eager to make the Fed's job much easier, and worked hard and spend political capital to accomplish that. That was about the only decade in which being a central banker was a fun and a happy experience.

Yes, debt levels are—I won't say unprecedented, certainly Britain after the Napoleonic Wars had a much larger debt overhang in proportion to GDP—. But counterbalancing that is the extraordinary willingness of and in fact eager demand by investors around the world for safe assets, which they define as the liabilities of governments that possess exorbitant privilege on a large scale—issuing their own debt to add to the world stock of reserves, and then rolling over that stock at interest rates less than the growth rate of the economy as a whole. It is very close to being a free lunch for Britain, for the European Union, for Japan, for the United States—and possibly soon for China—to issue debt.

Normally, when you borrow or when you accept deposits, you have to pay people interest for the use of their money. But Britain, the EU, Japan and the US are instead, effectively charging their lenders fees for keeping their money and wealth safe and liquid.That is and has been the situation for the past 15 years. How long will this last? No one can tell. But as long as it lasts, the market economy is telling us that, worldwide, investors regard the debts of the countries with exorbitant privilege as extraordinarily valuable assets. In a market economy you have very strong incentives if you can—you become healthy and wealthy, and people think you wise if you do—create incredibly valuable assets.

What worries me is the extremely short duration of all of these governments' debts. I really wish that the treasuries were testing the market by attempting substantial increases in average debt maturity. I still do not understand why Janet Yellen isn't issuing both a nominal and a inflation-indexed consol right now, and seeing what the market for those things are. That would bring us a great deal of valuable information about what the available space for fiscal management is that we do not now have.

====

Speaker 2:
That was the most amazing food. So yeah, I have my eye on the call and that somehow brings us to the end of our second session. So I'm actually going to hand back to Greg to run a quick poll, to see how the sector has changed over the course of the debate.

Speaker 3:
Thanks for that. So we're going to ask the the same question when we picked up the debate was so do you expect us to inflation in the in a 10 year period? I was kind of, it's a feed at above and below the the average of 2% come up.

Speaker 2:
Okay.

Speaker 3:
Okay. So I'm going to show her just the results of the question on what level in place you would need to get to to, to want you to take, you want to sell you financial assets, paper of stores of value. So the results should come from the screening shortly. We have a kind of going to be normal distribution with the majority of the, I don't know, 5% with with the towel kind of way to so the next ministerial C will be the original set of results to the big question. Inflation COVID [inaudible] obviously and it's gently biased towards about 2%.

Speaker 2:
Okay.

Speaker 3:
And now we'll see the, the post post the bank results for the same question. That's a little bit of a good. Okay. I'll hand back to you to the concluding comments. Okay.

Speaker 2:
Thanks, Greg. Among myself and a more foul, and I just want to say we get access to all two guests for joining us today. Actually we can all agree that professor get harder professor at all's perspective about it, and not as a color and texture to it rapidly evolving situation and kind of really central central question. I feel like we needed a week to get real debt photo practice, but I've certainly learned to knock at an autumn. And my outlook is, is it is a little beaker I got to say. But, but to console my cell phone now, and that's set the winners of the firearm raffle is Heather Foster. Chris [inaudible] is one day is way too. You'll add it to both our guests. So I'm going to close the session. Hey everyone. And thanks again to professor Goodheart and professor Coleman and everyone in the audience for joining us today. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:
[Inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].
