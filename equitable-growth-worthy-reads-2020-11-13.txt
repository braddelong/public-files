WORTHY READS FOR 2020-11-13
===========================

Worthy Reads from Equitable Growth:

1. Four pieces from Equitable Growths _Vision 2020_ <https://equitablegrowth.org/insights-expertise/vision-2020/> initiative are especially worth your attention this week—not because they are the most important, but because they are the most doable in the current environment. First is: _Combating the Market Power of U.S. Corporations Over Workers & Consumers_ <https://equitablegrowth.org/combating-the-market-power-of-u-s-corporations-over-workers-and-consumers/>: ‘the United States suffers from a growing market power problem. Market power, often referred to as monopoly power, means consumers pay more for the goods and services they need. Workers earn less. Small businesses have a harder time succeeding. Innovation slows. Market power exacerbates wealth inequality, too, because those who benefit from monopolies—the high-paid executives and stockholders of corporations—are wealthier, on average, than the consumers, workers, and small businesses who bear monopolies’ costs.... Antitrust enforcement is typically handled at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, and federal courts. It is governed primarily by Congress’ century-old policy direction in the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Clayton Act. The key resources below provide solutions for corralling corporate power through these antitrust enforcement tools…

2. _Reforming Unemployment Insurance Across the United States_ <https://equitablegrowth.org/reforming-unemployment-insurance-across-the-united-states/>: ‘Longstanding problems with the Unemployment Insurance system in the United States are immediately evident amid the coronavirus recession and echo the problems experienced during the Great Recession more than a decade ago. These include: (a) Administrative failures at state Unemployment Insurance agencies. (b) Lack of a permanent Unemployment Insurance program that includes the self-employed and others traditionally left out of the program. (c) Low benefit levels that require emergency top-offs. (d) The temporary nature of fixes when recessions hit, which, in turn, requires renegotiations just months after political compromises are reached. The current disarray in the Unemployment Insurance system is neither a surprise nor an accident. It is the result of decades of conscious choices made by policymakers at the state and federal levels: Over the past decade, many states limited Unemployment Insurance benefits, made accessing the program more difficult, and allocated insufficient funds for program administration. This results in chaos and uncertainty just when Unemployment Insurance is critical…

3. _Revamping U.S. Small Business Rescue Programs amid the Coronavirus Recession_ <https://equitablegrowth.org/revamping-u-s-small-business-rescue-programs-amid-the-coronavirus-recession/>: ‘Heading into 2021, policymakers should prioritize restructuring business aid so that small firms can be rescued with the same speed as large firms. The Paycheck Protection Program should be altered to help firms in high-rent areas, firms that are smaller and less well-connected to the banking system, and firms owned by Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. Longer term, policymakers should build public financial systems to make our economy resilient for the next downturn, including: (a) Increasing the capacity of the Small Business Administration. (b) Building a faster payment system. (c) Ensuring universal access to the banking system. (d) Creating established alternatives to ad hoc business rescue programs via the Federal Reserve…

4. _Building Worker Power in the United States_ <https://equitablegrowth.org/building-worker-power-in-the-united-states/>: ‘Labor market policies, such as minimum wages or premium pay amid the coronavirus pandemic, are not keeping up. Meanwhile, labor laws meant to protect collective action and unionization efforts, guarantee freedom from discrimination, and promote workplace safety are not well-enforced. Furthermore, trends such as domestic and international outsourcing and the fissuring of the workplace are changing the U.S. economy in ways our labor market institutions were not built to handle. These trends unbalance power between workers and corporations so that workers are not able to share in the high profits they create and the economic growth they drive…



Worthy Reads from Elsewhere:

1. For a generation now, American voters have been taught that majorities do not count much. For a generation now, Republicans have been taught that enormous success can be gained by suppressing votes, gerrymandering votes, and telling lies to their base which some media gatekeepers endorse while others say “opinions about the shape of the earth differ”. These will have ugly consequences. These issues are far outside of my wheelhouse. I claim no expertise. But they are worth a great deal of your attention. Thus most of this week’s items are intended to direct your attention at these issues—not equitable growth ones. I do not apologize. Next week I will be back to normal. But this week I want to direct your attention elsewhere. And Ezra Klein is not a bad guide to trying to think these issues through:

**Ezra Klein**: _Trump & the 2020 Election Show the Problem Is too Little Democracy_ <https://www.vox.com/21561011/2020-election-joe-biden-donald-trump-electoral-college-vote-senate-democracy>: ‘A party that adapts to anti-democratic rules will quickly become a party that fears democracy. A party that knows it can’t win a majority of the vote will try to make it difficult for majorities to vote, and have those votes count. A party that isn’t punished for betraying the public trust will keep betraying it. If Republicans were more worried about winning back some of Biden’s voters rather than placating Trump’s base, they wouldn’t be indulging his post-election tantrum. It would be offensive to the voters they’re losing, and who they’ll need in the future. But they’re not, and so they have aligned themselves with Trump’s claims of theft—with profoundly dangerous consequences for America.Donald Trump is not in the White House, refusing to accept the results of the election, because America is polarized. He is there because of the electoral college. Mitch McConnell is not favored to remain Senate majority leader because America is polarized. He is favored to remain Senate majority leader because the Senate is the most undemocratic legislative chamber in the western world, and the only way Republicans can lose control is to lose successive landslide elections, as happened in 2006 and 2008. In politics, as in any competition, the teams adopt the strategies the rules demand. America’s political parties are adopting the strategies that their very different electoral positions demand. That’s made the Democratic Party a big-tent, center-left coalition that puts an emphasis on pluralistic outreach. And it’s let the Republican Party adopt more extreme candidates, dangerous strategies, and unpopular agendas, because it can win most elections even while it’s losing most voters…



2. What steps will Twitter, Facebook, Fox News, and Donald Trump’s other media enablers—all of whom have profited mightily from the many steps they have taken to boost his audience and influence—take with respect to Donald Trump in the future? The smart Adi Robertson believes that after he leaves the White House they will all take steps to cut off his oxygen. I cannot see it. Did they cut off Sarah Palin’s oxygen?:

**Adi Robertson**: _Twitter: Trump Loses His Special Privileges with the Presidency_ <https://boingboing.net/2020/11/10/twitter-trump-loses-his-special-privileges-with-the-presidency.html>: ‘"Twitter's approach to world leaders, candidates, and public officials is based on the principle that people should be able to choose to see what their leaders are saying with clear context. This means that we may apply warnings and labels, and limit engagement to certain tweets. This policy framework applies to current world leaders and candidates for office, and not private citizens when they no longer hold these positions," a Twitter spokesperson confirms to The Verge. These changes will cover Trump's personal account. Position-specific accounts like @WhiteHouse, @POTUS, and @FLOTUS are transferred to a new administration after an outgoing president steps down…



3. This strikes me as whistling past the graveyard by the usually reliable Rana Faroohar. Yes, Joe Biden can through executive action get the US government back to 80% of what it was in 2016. But he can get it no farther. And the damage done over the past four years will remain. Near-gridlock makes repair of damage to the country very difficult, and makes significant progress to build back better almost unattainable:

**Rana Faroohar**: _Joe Biden Can Get Plenty Done, Even If Congress Is Divided_ <https://www.ft.com/content/757213c7-2bf1-4195-af4a-2d4ac72546a2>: ‘Biden... has the power of the federal government at his disposal. Mr Trump found all sorts of ways to govern by executive order; Mr Biden can do the same. He has already announced plans to name his own task force to deal with the coronavirus pandemic on Monday and is likely to rejoin the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, and to repeal travel bans from some Muslim-majority countries. He could start to clean up human rights violations that have become part of the immigration process, making sure all of the children detained alone at the US border with Mexico are united with their parents. He could also ensure that any federal contracts awarded are given to companies with high labour, safety and environmental standards.... There are still hundreds of billions of dollars yet to be spent under the Cares Act, which was passed to help the country deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. That money would be under Mr Biden’s executive control. In the short term, some of it should go to what Mr Biden calls “the caring economy”, bolstering the healthcare safety net for more Americans, and ensuring more high-speed Covid-19 testing. If every school, shopping mall, theatre, restaurant, office or other public space offered high-speed testing, that could limit the health and economic damage from the virus that is surging once again throughout the country. Education spending runs a close second.... There could also be some overlap in Democratic and Republican agendas in areas like trade and national security that Mr Biden could leverage.... osh Hawley, Marco Rubio and Rob Portman have supported the idea of a national investment strategy.... Improving relations with Europe would be another smart move.... There is so much low-hanging fruit to be plucked right now by improving relations with allies in Europe and elsewhere, from setting common standards for digital taxation and 5G, to cutting a new US-EU privacy deal, to coming up with a common approach to deal with Chinese state-run capitalism, to working together to curb Big Tech’s power and rethink competition policy. Diplomacy is an area where Mr Biden may well shine. And he won’t need Republican support for that…

4. I think Tim Duy here overlooks the next year. Lots more damage will be done to the economy and the society over the next two months of interegnum. Then there remains at least a six-month gap before large-scale vaccine distribution is likely to begin. The Biden economy is likely to have a great 2022, and a good 2023 and 2024. But the next year will be hellish. Tim is, I think, very overoptimistic in overlooking that:

**Tim Duy**: _Economy Has Momentum, But So Does the Virus_ <https://blogs.uoregon.edu/timduyfedwatch/2020/11/09/economy-has-momentum-but-so-does-the-virus/>: ‘Biden might have been dealt something of a lucky hand with respect to the economy. As a general rule, it is much better to have the recession at the front end of your administration than the back end. Even though he will likely face a recalcitrant Senate, do not mistake the current situation for the last recovery. A vast stockpile of savings is sitting in the background to fuel the economy next year, giving Biden a massive economic tailwind. Moreover, there was nothing wrong with the economy at the beginning of the year; there were no structural problems that needed to be fixed. Biden also has the opportunity to ride the downside of the current Covid-19 surge and the upside of the coming vaccine. And he has a Fed that has already committed to holding rates zero; President Obama had a Fed that was always looking to unwind. Looking past the current Covid-surge, there is a lot to like here…



5. From my tickler file on related issues: Ken White has smart things to say about establishment intellectuals and journalists who are really, really upset at the fact that in an open society criticism can sometimes be be intemperate:

**Popehat**: _‘I like and respect many of these people_ <https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/1280662627014721536> who signed “A Letter on Justice and Open Debate". But I continue to struggle with the concept. The distinction between “silencing” and more/responsive/critical speech eludes me. I see instead the problem of the preferred first speaker. “The problem of the preferred first speaker” is the tendency to impose norms of civility, openness, productiveness, and dialogue-encourag[ement] on a RESPONSE to expression that we do not impose on the expression itself. On the other hand, some of the reactions to this seem absolutely devoted to making its point. Ugh. No seriously, now I wonder if the letter was crafted to make its point not in its text but through the anticipated reactions. Good Lord above people. I mean if that was their intent—to illustrate their proposition through anticipated reactions—I have to compliment them on their craft, even if I don't agree with them entirely…



6. Also from my tickler file on related issues. It is still amazing how very little thought people working for the New York Times have given to the question of what it might mean to report “all the news that is fit to print“ in the attention-economy world of informational autocracy. Yet it remains the case. That anybody—anybody—could think even for an instant that printing lies without context is a direct way of “exposing” anyone is something I still have to shake myself in order to believe. And reflect that Michelle Goldberg views this piece as a strong critique of the _New York Times_ ginning up and publishing the Cotton op-ed:

**Michelle Goldberg:** _Tom Cotton’s Fascist Op-Ed_ <https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2020/06/michelle-goldberg-gives-her-employers.html>: ‘I figured he’d helpfully revealed himself as a dangerous authoritarian.... I can sort of appreciate my bosses’ decision... to run Senator Tom Cotton’s screed.... The Times Opinion section wants to include the views of people who support Trump, and the very qualities that make Cotton’s Op-Ed revolting—his strongman pretensions, his sneering apocalypticism—make him an important figure in Trump’s Republican Party. (He might someday come to lead it.) Readers should grasp what people like Cotton are arguing, not because it’s worth taking seriously but because it is being taken seriously, particularly by our mad and decomposing president.... The paper could convey his views by reporting on them, but for the Opinion section, letting him express them himself is more direct…



7. Freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of non-association, rights to equal respect in the public sphere, and rights to economic advantage and security all mix together in a strange public-sphere debate chopped salad. I confess I have not thought all these issues through satisfactorily: 

**Steve Randy Waldmann**: _Social democracy & Freedom_ <https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7557.html>: ‘In 1962, Milton Friedman famously argued that liberal capitalism and political freedom go together.... "Viewed as a means to the end of political freedom, economic arrangements are important because of their effect on the concentration or dispersion of power. The kind of economic organization that provides economic freedom directly, namely, competitive capitalism, also promotes political freedom because it separates economic power from political power and in this way enables the one to offset the other..."  Capitalism and Freedom was written in the heyday of the Kuznets curve, which posited that extreme inequality was self-correcting and had largely already self-corrected.... Friedman celebrated moderate inequality, on the theory that a world with many captains of industry would have many and diverse philanthropists to whom partisans of unpopular causes could make their case and find sponsorship. The logic of the argument rests on the notion that capitalism preserves political diversity that cuts across the structure of wealth and power.... There is an obvious critique of this from the left. Political diversity won’t cut across structures of wealth and power evenly. Humans, including fabulously wealthy humans, are quirky, so sure, there’ll be some Friedrich Engelses and Nick Hanauers. But the winners of an economic game by and large will promote views that celebrate and entrench the game they continually win.... There’s lots more scope to make a living at Mercatus than at People’s Policy Project, for partisans willing to adjust their politics accordingly. Capitalism, then, buys the appearance of political diversity (every voice is in the room!), but puts a fat thumb on the scale for the interests of the wealthy and powerful...



8. And, in closing, still far outside my wheelhouse, Ezra Klein direct us to the very thoughtful Anne Applebaum on how people become fascists:

 **Ezra Klein**: _The Crisis Isn’t Trump. It’s the Republican Party_ <https://www.vox.com/21562116/anne-applebaum-twilight-of-democracy-gop-trump-election-fraud-2020-biden-the-ezra-klein-show>: ‘Some Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, have wholeheartedly endorsed Trump’s claims.... Others—including Vice President Mike Pence and Sens. Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley—have signaled solidarity with the president, while not quite endorsing his conspiracy theories. The message is clear: When faced with the choice of loyalty to Trump and the legitimacy of the democratic process, Republicans are more than willing to throw democracy under the bus. Anne Applebaum.... We discuss why most politicians under increasingly autocratic regimes choose to collaborate with the regime, how Graham went from outspoken Trump critic to one of Trump’s most vocal supporters in the US Senate, why the Republican Party ultimately took the path of Sarah Palin, what we can expect to happen if and when a much more capable demagogue emerges.... Anne Applebaum: "If this were happening in another country, we would be talking about a populist authoritarian seeking to create disillusion with democracy in his country in order to have a base of supporters who will help him return to power. But I don’t think we have to talk about it as if it were another country. I’m very happy to use the same language that I would use if this were happening in Brazil or Argentina or anywhere else.... There is one sentiment, I think, that links the people... disappointment.... Whether it’s the superficiality of modern democracy, the demographic change that they don’t want or like, the decline in morals and values.... It’s a feeling of loss or disappointment, and sometimes... despair. “My society has ended.”... How do people end up going along with corruption if their company is carrying out some kind of scam? The studies show that it’s always a step-by-step process. You accept one aspect of it: “Well, everybody else is keeping double books, so I can, too. That’s just what people do in this company, and it’s normal.” And then the next step.... This is very similar to what happens in occupied countries.... Something like that also happened inside the Republican Party: People who thought of themselves as patriots, as good people—as politicians working in the interest of the United States—made small decisions over time, each time reminding themselves of why what they were doing was for the good of the country.... This is an attempt to create a new kind of base: an enraged receiving base, which will always think that the election was stolen and which will always assume that something went wrong and will always feel that they were deprived of something. And this base will then have uses in the future...
